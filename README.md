## Under the hood

This project utilizes the following:

## Building NPM modules

Execute the command: ```npm i``` in the root directory to build the backend modules. Repeat the process in the frontend directory for the frontend modules.

## Running the project

## Documentation

The blog is built with a mobile-first approach, with a default dark theme. A lightweight but feature-rich control panel is meant to make blog management a breeze.

## Future improvements
